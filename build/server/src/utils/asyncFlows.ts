/**
 * Makes sure the target async function is running only once at every instant.
 * It's similar to throttle, but instead of waiting an interval it waits for
 * completition. It uses the async.cargo function to achieve this behaviour.
 *
 *  Requests:       || | | ||| |                              |
 *  Function runs:  |--------------->|------------->|         |---------->|
 *
 *                  Multiple rapid calls are queued           Then it will wait
 *                  but the function will run one             for future calls
 *                  last time since there has been            and run when
 *                  a call after it started running           requested
 *
 * [NOTE]: The target function should NEVER be called with different arguments
 * since the arguments of non-first callers will be ignored.
 * [ONLY] use this function in recurring state checks, i.e. `natRenewal/index.ts`
 *
 * @param fn Target function
